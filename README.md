# My own emacs config

It's mostly an evolution to my own taste from the Clojure-friendly
emacs config from [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/).

If you're new to emacs, check out
[this introductory tutorial](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)!

## Installing

1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d` if they exist. (Windows users, your
   emacs files will probably live in
   `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\`. So, for example, you
   would delete `C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d`.) This is
   where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files
   and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
3. Clone the contents of this repo into `~/.emacs.d`
4. Create the file `~/.lein/profiles.clj` (Windows users, this is
   probably `C:\Users\your_user_name\.lein\profiles.clj`) and add this
   line to it:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.15.0-snapshot"]]}} 
```

Last but not least, open Emacs.

## Organization

There's an effort to separate everything logically and document the purpose
of every line. [`init.el`](./init.el) acts as a kind of table of
contents.  It's a good idea to eventually go through `init.el` and the
files under the `customizations` directory so that you know exactly
what's going on.

## Supporting CSS, HTML, JS, etc.

Emacs has decent support for CSS, HTML, JS, and many other file types out of the box, but if you want better support, then have a look at [my personal emacs config's init.el](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/blob/master/init.el). It's meant to read as a table of contents. The emacs.d as a whole adds the following:

* [Customizes js-mode and html editing](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/blob/master/customizations/setup-js.el)
    * Sets indentation level to 2 spaces for JS
    * enables subword-mode so that M-f and M-b break on capitalization changes
    * Uses `tagedit` to give you paredit-like functionality when editing html
    * adds support for coffee mode
* [Uses enh-ruby-mode for ruby editing](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/blob/master/customizations/setup-ruby.el). enh-ruby-mode is a little nicer than the built-in ruby-mode, in my opinion.
    * Associates many filenames and extensions with enh-ruby-mode (.rb, .rake, Rakefile, etc)
    * Adds keybindings for running specs
* Adds support for YAML and SCSS using the yaml-mode and scss-mode packages

In general, if you want to add support for a language then you should be able to find good instructions for it through Google. Most of the time, you'll just need to install the "x-lang-mode" package for it.
